Exercise 1 – Single Neuron Gradient Descent

Description:
Implement gradient descent based on the logistic loss function.

Details:

Initialize weight vector w = (0, …, 0)

Perform T update steps with learning rate α

At each step, compute the total loss:

𝐽
𝑡
=
∑
𝑖
𝑙
𝑖
J
t
	​

=
i
∑
	​

l

	​


Return:

Final weight vector w

Loss history J = [J1, …, JT]

Weight history w = [w1, …, wT]
