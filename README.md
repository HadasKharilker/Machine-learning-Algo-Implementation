Great idea ðŸ™Œ A clear **README structure** will make your ML exercises repo look professional and easy to follow.

Hereâ€™s a template you can use (and extend as you add more exercises):

##  Exercises

### Exercise 1 â€“ Single Neuron Gradient Descent

**Description:**
Implement gradient descent based on the logistic loss function.

**Details:**

* Initialize weight vector **w = (0, â€¦, 0)**
* Perform **T** update steps with learning rate **Î±**
* At each step, compute the total loss:

  $$
  J_t = \sum_i l_i
  $$
* Return:

  * Final weight vector **w**
  * Loss history **J = \[J1, â€¦, JT]**
  * Weight history **w = \[w1, â€¦, wT]**
